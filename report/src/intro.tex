There has now been over 60 years since Markov decision processes have proven to
be useful in decision making and that associated \enquote{\textit{models have 
gained recognition in such diverse fields as ecology, economics,
and communications engineering}}~\cite{puterman2014markov}.
They are therefore an important topic to study and this report presents
our key results applied in the framework of a \emph{Snakes and Ladders} game.

This report will first present in section~\ref{sec:model_and_strategy},
a detailed description of our Markov \emph{model}
as well as the strategy we followed to get the optimal choice of dice.
Then, section~\ref{sec:implementation} will present our concrete \emph{implementation}
of the game and its simulations.
Finally, the most relevant results and strategies comparison as well as
further work discussion will be described in section~\ref{sec:results}.

As a final note before jumping into the subject, we wanted to
emphasize that this project not only allowed us to get some
insights on the theoretical and practical aspects of MDPs
but it also lead us to discover a new programming language, \textsc{Julia},
which both made us very enthusiastic as it is relatively new
and rapidly growing in the scientific community.
