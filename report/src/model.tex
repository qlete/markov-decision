A first assumption in the way we defined our board concerns the non-existence
of domino effect of traps. This means that the only way to activate a trap
is to fall on its box immediately after one dice throw.
For example, if one lands on box 8, which is a type 3 [??? type 2 if we can not
modify the project rules] trap, it brings us back to box 5. In this case,
even if box 5 is a trap, it won't affect us until the following dice throw
(i.e. if a 0 is made at the following dice throw).
