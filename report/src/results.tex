\subsection{Choosing the board} % (fold)
\label{sub:choosing_the_board}
In order to analyse the behavior of the game in various situations,
we decided to define four boards that globally represent the possible
distributions of traps on the board. They are defined as
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A \emph{uniformly low} density trap-distributed board,
  \item a \emph{left high} density trap-distributed board,
  \item a \emph{right high} density trap-distributed board,
  \item and a \emph{uniformly high} density trap-distributed board.
\end{enumerate}
The results presented in this section will correspond to the first case,
as it is likely to represent most of real life \emph{Snake and Ladder} games.
However, appendix~\ref{app:additional_error_plots} will contain the results
of the three other board distributions and some comment on them will be
made at the end of this section.
