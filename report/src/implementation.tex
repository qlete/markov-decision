\section{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sec:implementation}
Now that the model and strategy has been described in the previous
section, we will focus on the \emph{implementation}.
As mentioned in the introduction, we decided to use the \textsc{Julia}
programming language as our coding partner.
Using \textsc{Julia} intuitive package generator, we were able to
produce beautiful documentation and we therefore strongly advise
the reader to have a look at the \textsc{html} documentation located
in \texttt{html_doc} by opening \texttt{index.html}.
The latter contains a structured presentation of the architecture
of our code as well as a description of each function.

\todo{Describe precise complicated parts? Still describe global
architecture even if it is in HTML doc?}
