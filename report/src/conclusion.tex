In this work, we investigated the use of Markov Decision Processes
to find the optimal solution to the \textit{Snake and Ladder} game. 
Our results show that this game can indeed be model as a Markov process, 
that the implementation of MDPs in this framework is simple,
that it leads to finding the optimal strategy and that this strategy
outperforms to a large extend some simple heuristic strategies. 

As a final note, we wanted to
emphasize that this project not only allowed us to get some
insights on the theoretical and practical aspects of MDPs
but it also lead us to discover a new programming language, \textsc{Julia},
which both made us very enthusiastic as it is relatively new
and rapidly growing in the scientific community.
